# Procedural Planet

This project showcases a procedural generation technique to create realistic-looking planets. It employs various algorithms to generate terrain, textures, and atmospheric effects, resulting in visually stunning and diverse planetary landscapes.

## Overview

The Procedural Planet project is a demonstration of procedural content generation techniques applied to planetary rendering. It focuses on creating planets with randomized terrain features, including mountains, valleys, oceans, and continents, to simulate realistic celestial bodies.

## Features

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Utilizes algorithms to create diverse landscapes with varying elevations, biomes, and geological features.
- **Dynamic Texturing**: Generates textures for different terrain types such as grasslands, deserts, snow-capped mountains, and more.
<!-- - **Atmospheric Effects**: Simulates atmospheric scattering and rendering effects for a realistic look and feel. -->
<!-- - **Interactive Visualization**: Allows for exploration and interaction with the generated planets through a user-friendly interface. -->

## Usage
